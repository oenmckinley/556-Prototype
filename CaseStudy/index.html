    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Here is an overview of the problem facing users.</p>
    <p> Students tend to have difficulty eating healthy meals. </p>
    <p> 
        A key reason for this is because they lack the time to prepare healthy meals. This can be due to the time constraints of their school schedules and school work. For example, students have to attend classes, study for exams, and complete assignments. For students who work part-time or have family-related responsibilities, this problem becomes even more difficult to resolve. The time constraints can become evermore exacerbated as deadlines are approaching for key milestones, such as exams and projects. Some students attempt to work around this problem by eating fast food or cheap restaurants, but this can lead to health problems and other issues. Moreover, the lack of time can also lead to a lack of motivation and energy, which can further exacerbate the problem, causing students to be subjected to a feedback loop effect that is difficult to escape from. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key reason for this problem is that students often lack the knowledge and skills to prepare healthy meals in a short period of time. For example, they may not realize that a veggie stir fry takes less than half an hour to prepare. This can lead to them either taking too long to prepare healthy meals or not preparing them at all, which can lead to health problems and other issues. It can even impact their overall health and well-being. One interviewee reported she would suffer mood problems when she ate instant noodles instead of healthy meals. Another stated that when she skipped meals, she would have difficulty concentrating, which clearly impacted her ability to learn and complete assignments.

    <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>
    <p>Here is an overview of User Interviews.</p>
    <p>This should include why we did interviews instead of surveys, etc. (because of the richness and depth of qualitative data?)</p>

    <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>

    <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
    <p>What we learned from the process, what we would do differently, and what we would do next if this were to be a real app?</p>
