    <h3>Case Study - CSE 556A</h3>
    <h1>CookMate - Meal Prep for Students on a Budget</h1>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Here is an overview of the problem facing users.</p>
    <p> Students tend to have difficulty eating healthy meals. </p>
    <p> 
        A key reason for this is because they lack the time to prepare healthy meals. This can be due to the time constraints of their school schedules and school work. For example, students have to attend classes, study for exams, and complete assignments. For students who work part-time or have family-related responsibilities, this problem becomes even more difficult to resolve. The time constraints can become evermore exacerbated as deadlines are approaching for key milestones, such as exams and projects. Some students attempt to work around this problem by eating fast food or cheap restaurants, but this can lead to health problems and other issues. Moreover, the lack of time can also lead to a lack of motivation and energy, which can further exacerbate the problem, causing students to be subjected to a feedback loop effect that is difficult to escape from. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key reason for this problem is that students often lack the knowledge and skills to prepare healthy meals in a short period of time. For example, they may not realize that a veggie stir fry takes less than half an hour to prepare. This can lead to them either taking too long to prepare healthy meals or not preparing them at all, which can lead to health problems and other issues. It can even impact their overall health and well-being. One interviewee reported she would suffer mood problems when she ate instant noodles instead of healthy meals. Another stated that when she skipped meals, she would have difficulty concentrating, which clearly impacted her ability to learn and complete assignments.

    <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>
    <p>Here is an overview of User Interviews.</p>
    <p>This should include why we did interviews instead of surveys, etc. (because of the richness and depth of qualitative data?)</p>
    <p>
        Various interviews were conducted with students so as to understand their habits around preparing and eating healthy meals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One interviewee stated that he had good relationship with his eating habits. He normally ate three meals a day. For breakfast, he would have some yogurt. For lunch, he would normally purchase a pre-made salad. For dinner, he would buy food from campus, and this was when he would consume the bulk of his protein and carbohydrates. In between, he normally resorted to the consumption of health snacks, such as apples. This interviewee is a key case of someone who could benefit from our application. He clearly does not have the ability to prepare healthy meals in a short period of time. Otherwise, he would not resort to purchasing most of his meals. However, he could easily learn how to do so with our application. This individual is an important case to consider because his situation in great detail shows that even students who eat health can have difficulty in preparing healthy meals in a short period of time. Moreover, it goes to show how it is the case that students choose to eat pre-made food instead of cooking their own meals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another interviewee stated that he had difficulty eating healthy. He would normally purchase pre-made food, such as pre-made pizzas. He stated that he subjected himself to this eating habit due to the lack of time as well as the fact that he cannot easily access on-campus food owing to the fact that he lives off campus. This another individual who could benefit from our application. He clearly lacks the ability to prepare health meals in a time-efficient manner. However, with our application, he could easily learn how to do so. This individual is an important case to consider because his situation of living off campus is not unusual for students, and cases similar to his can very well be generalized across much of the student body not just at Washington University but at other universities as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was an interviewee who had a mixed relationship with eating healthy. While this individual sought to eat well, she sometimes ate instant noodles to save time. This individual also spends an hour a day cooking at home if the time is available. However, this individual still does not shy away from fast food. This is another individual who could benefit from our application. With our application, she could find ways to prepare healthy meals without having to resort to instant noodles.

    <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
    <p>Here is an overview of the paper prototype, with pics and revisions.</p>

    <p>After the first user test, we made a number of changes.</p>
    <p>
        Aside from the calendar view, this included revising the entire home page and all recipe pages (though some of the text pieces for lists were kept). The changes made were largely for clarity, including clearer/larger text and placement of items to be more straightforward. It also included features that had been initially left out of the prototype in error, including the ability to “favorite” (or save for later) recipes to later use and add to the plan calendar. It also included changing the calendar view to include labels for “Breakfast”, “Lunch”, and “Dinner” to better communicate where different meals should be placed.
    </p>
    <p>After user tests 2 and 3, we made a number of changes.</p>
    <p>
        We printed the description of user tasks out so that the user can go back to the task when they are lost. At the beginning of the task, we would ask the user to read and ask questions if they have any. We created colored star stickers so that the user can click “Star,” which turns the start icon red, letting the user know that it has been added to the “Favorites” list. We also created more ingredients and extra recipes so that the user can get more results when they try to filter the recipe. We created a video page so that when the user clicks the recipe, it allows the user to watch the video and learn how to make a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The action cycle can be conceptualized in relation to the change made that turns the star icon red. First, the user wants to add a recipe to the “Favorites” list. The intention is to press the star icon. The sequence of actions that are planned is to press the star icon. The physical execution of the action sequence is to press the star icon. With the change that has been made, one can perceive a change. The change is that the star icon is now red. Before the change, the color of the star would not have changed. Interpreting the change in color in line with one’s expectations, the user can see that the color of the star icon has changed in line with the user’s expectations. Before the change in the prototype, the star not changing in color would confuse the user, who would have thought that the star would change in color due to the star having been pressed. With the change to the prototype having been implemented, the user evaluates the result as being conducive to the user’s expectations, giving the user a more intuitive and comfortable user experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After user test 4, we made a number of changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        We added + add on button on the recipes which were missing + button. Before handing out the task page, we explained to the user how to perform the user testing: speak out loud what you are trying to do and what you are performing. On the Dietary Restriction filter, we added options for searching for allergies and gave the user the ability to click allergies they had under the allergy option. This allowed them to filter out the allergy they had and remove the recipe containing the ingredients they were allergic to. We created more colored star stickers to support the user having multiples of favorites. However, these implementations were not used during the user testing because they did not use the “Favorite” feature. We created more ingredients and recipes to the list to support more options.

    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <p>Here is an overview of the final prototype, with pics and link, and ties back to the original user research.</p>

    <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
    <p>What we learned from the process, what we would do differently, and what we would do next if this were to be a real app?</p>
